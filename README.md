# HW-Embedded-Software-Assignement
This program is simulating a car physics in C++. The aim is to use real-time function such as treads and semaphores to create a realistic physics of a car.
The embedded system has 3 buttons.

1 - Acceleration
2 - Break
3 - Cruise mod

Each of them uses interrputs and thread to update the physics equations with new inputs. caluclation in real time the exacte position of the car on a straight line.
You can find more information on the PDF.
